Description: Phenotype simulator allows for the flexible simulation of 
    phenotypes under different models, including fixed and background genetic 
    effects as well as correlated, fixed and background noise effects. Different 
    phenotypic effects can be combined into a final phenotype while controling 
    for the proportion of variance explained by each of the components. For each 
    component, the number of variables, their distribution and the design of 
    their effect across traits can be customised.
