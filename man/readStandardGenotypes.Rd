\title{Read genotype from file.}
\usage{
readStandardGenotypes(filename, format = NULL, verbose = TRUE,
  sampleID = "ID_", snpID = "SNP_", delimiter = ",")
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{path/to/genotypefile [string] in plink, oxgen 
(impute2/snptest/hapgen2), genome, bimbam or [delimiter]-delimited format (
for format information see \emph{External genotype software and formats}).}

\item{format}{name [string] of genotype file format. Options are: "plink", 
"oxgen", "genome", "bimbam" or "delim"}

\item{verbose}{boolean; if TRUE, progress info is printed to standard out}

\item{sampleID}{prefix [string] for naming samples (followed by sample number 
from 1 to NrSamples)}

\item{snpID}{prefix [string] for naming SNPs (followed by SNP number 
from 1 to NrSNPs)}

\item{delimiter}{field separator [string] of genotype file}
}
\value{
List of [NrSamples X NrSNPs] genotypes, their [NrSNPs] ID (id_snps), 
their [NrSamples] IDs (id_samples) and format specific additional files (
might be used for output writing).
}
\description{
readStandardGenotypes can read genotypes from a number of input 
formats for standard GWAS (binary plink, snptest, bimbam) or simulation 
software (binary plink, hapgen2, genome). Alternatively, simple text files (
with specified delimiter) can be read. For more information on the different 
file formats see \emph{External genotype software and formats}.

\section{External genotype software and formats}{

\subsection{Formats:}{
\itemize{
\item PLINK: consists of three files, .bed, .bim and .fam. When specifying 
the filepath, only the core of the name without the ending should be 
specified (i.e. for geno.bed, geno.bim and geno.fam, geno should be 
specified). When reading data from plink file, the absolute path to plink-
format file has to be provided, tilde extansion not provided.
From \url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats}:  The .bed 
files contain the  primary representation of genotype calls at biallelic 
variants in a binary format. The .bim is a text file with no header 
line, and one line  per variant with the following six fields: i) Chromosome 
code (either an integer, or 'X'/'Y'/'XY'/'MT'; '0' indicates unknown) or 
name, ii) Variant identifier, iii) Position in morgans or centimorgans (safe 
to use dummy value of '0'), iv) Base-pair coordinate (normally 1-based, but 
0 ok; limited to 231-2), v) Allele 1 (corresponding to clear bits in .bed; 
usually minor), vi) Allele 2 (corresponding to set bits in .bed; usually 
major). The .fam file is a text file with no header line, and one line per 
sample with the following six fields: i) Family ID ('FID'), ii), Within-
family ID ('IID'; cannot be '0'), iii) Within-family ID of father ('0' if 
father isn't in dataset, iv) within-family ID of mother ('0' if mother isn't 
in dataset), v) sex code ('1' = male, '2' = female, '0' = unknown), vi) 
Phenotype value ('1' = control, '2' = case, '-9'/'0'/non-numeric = missing 
data if case/control)
\item oxgen: consists of two files, the genotype file ending in .gen 
and the sample file ending in .sample. When specifying the filepath, only
the core of the name without the ending should be specified (i.e. for 
geno.gen and geno.sample, geno should be specified). From
 \url{http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~marchini/software/gwas/file_format.html}:
The genotype file stores data on a one-line-per-SNP format. The first 5 
entries of each line should be the SNP ID, RS ID of the SNP, base-pair 
position of the SNP, the allele coded A and the allele coded B. The SNP ID 
can be used to denote the chromosome number of each SNP. The next three 
numbers on the line should be the probabilities of the three genotypes AA, 
AB and BB at the SNP for the first individual in the cohort. The next three 
numbers should be the genotype probabilities for the second individual in the 
cohort. The next three numbers are for the third individual and so on. The 
order of individuals in the genotype file should match the order of the 
individuals in the sample file. The sample file has three parts (a) a header 
line detailing the names of the columns in the file, (b) a line detailing the 
types of variables stored in each column, and (c) a line for each individual 
detailing the information for that individual. For more information on the 
sampple file visit the above url
\item genome: The entire output of genome can be saved via `genome -options >
outoutfile`. The /path/to/outputfile should be provided and this function
extracts the relevant genotype information from this outout file.
\url{http://csg.sph.umich.edu/liang/genome}
\item bimbam: Mean genotype file format of bimbam which is a single file, 
without information on individuals. From 
\url{http://www.haplotype.org/bimbam.html}: The first column of the mean 
genotype files is the SNP ID, the second and third columns are allele types 
with minor allele first. The rest columns are the mean genotypes of different 
individuals â€“ numbers between 0 and 2 that represents the (posterior) mean 
genotype, or dosage of the minor allele.
\item delim: A [delimter]-delimited file of [NrSNPs x NrSamples] genotypes 
with the snpIDs in the first column and the sampleIDs in the first row and 
genotypes encoded as numbers between 0 and 2 representing the (posterior) 
mean genotype, or dosage of the minor allele. Can be user-genotypes or 
genotypes simulated with foward-time algorithms such as simupop 
(\url{http://simupop.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage}) or MetaSim 
(\url{project.org/web/packages/rmetasim/vignettes/CreatingLandscapes.html}), 
that allow for user-specified output formats

\item PLINK: simple, bi-allelelic genotypes without LD structure, details can 
be found at \url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/input#simulate}.
\item Hapgen2: resampling-based genotype simulation, details can be found at
\url{http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/hapgen/hapgen2.html}.
\item Genome: coalescent-based genotype simulation, details can be found at
